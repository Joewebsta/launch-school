# Exception handling allows us to anticipate errors in our programs and handle
# them in such a way that the program does not crash and meaningful information
# is provided to the programmer so they can troubleshoot the issue.

# Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error
# occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by changing the
# flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
