# Leap years occur in every year that is evenly divisible by 4, unless the year is also divisible by 100.
# If the year is evenly divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year unless the year is evenly divisible by 400.

# If divisible by 4 -> leap year
# If divisble by 100 && divisible by 400 - leap year
# If divisible by 4 && divisible by 100 - NOT leap year
